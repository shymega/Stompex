defmodule Stompex.FrameBuilder do
  @moduledoc """
  Provides functionality for building a stomp frame. This can be
  used for both sending and receiving frames, and simply generates
  a new Frame struct.

  All functions in the FrameBuilder module can be piped, with each
  returning the frame with the updates.

  ## Example

      import Stompex.FrameBuilder

      new_frame
      |> set_command("SEND")
      |> put_header("message-id", "123456abc")
      |> put_header("sender", "stompex")
      |> content_type("application/json")
      |> set_body("{ \"test\": \"test\",")
      |> append_body("\"test2\": \"test2\"}")
      |> finish_frame

  As a shortcut, frames can also be created via the command helpers.
  These will generate a frame with the command pre-populated. For example:

      $ send_frame()
        %Stompex.Frame{ cmd: "SEND" }

  **Please note** that there are only helpers available for client
  frames, and NOT server frames. Commands such as `CONNECTED` or
  `RECEIPT` if needed must be created explicitly, but should not
  be needed as Stompex does not implement a server.
