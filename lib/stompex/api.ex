      Subscribes to a specific queue or topic. Once subscribed,
      any messages received from the server will be sent to the
      handlers if configured.

      This function allows you to specify any headers that are
      required by your server. By default, the `id` header will
      be automatically generated, but you may specify your own
      if required.

      One important header you may wish to specify is the `ack`
      header which defines whether or not you must explicitly
      acknowledge the receipt of a message. By default, this is
      set to `auto`, but can be set to one of the following
      options:

      - auto
      - client
      - client-individual

      When set to `auto`, you are not required to send an acknowledgement
      back to the server.
      When set to `client` or `client-individual`, you MUST send an acknowledgement back.

          Stompex.subscribe("/topics/main", conn, %{ "ack" => "client" })

      this subscription.

      - :compressed - Whether or not the incoming frame contains a body
      that is gzip compressed. If set to `true` Stompex will decompress
      the body before passing on the frame. If `false` (default), no

      As an alternative to registering a callback function per
      destination, it is possible to have Stompex send frames
      to the calling process instead. This function allows you
      to enable or disable this functionality.

      This is particularly useful if you're using Stompex within
      another process such as a GenServer. When used, your process
      will receive a message containing a tuple with the received
      frame, and the destination that it originated from. It is
      then up to you to manage your processing accordingly.

      ## Example

      Below is a simple example of how this may be used within a
      GenServer. The connection is setup on the initialisation of
      the server, and subscriptions are setup. One initialised,
      the `handle_info/2` function will be called with the frames.

      Here you can pattern match on the destination the frame
      originated from, or simply have a single `handle_info/2`
      function and manage it yourself.
